	  <h2>About Perl School</h2>
          <p>The Perl School brand has its roots in a series of low-cost
            Perl training courses that Dave Cross ran in 2012. By running
            low-cost training at the weekend, he hoped to encourage more
            programmers to keep their Perl knowledge up to date. These
            courses were run regularly for about a year before the idea
            was put on hold for a while.</p>

          <p>Dave always knew that he would want to return to the Perl
            School brand at some point and late in 2017 he realised what
            the obvious next step was - low-cost Perl books. He had already
            developed a pipeline for creating e-books from Markdown files
            so it was a short step to republishing some of his training
            materials as books.</p>

          <p>The first Perl School book,
            <a href="/books/perl-taster/"><i>Perl Taster</i></a> was published
            at the end of 2017 (just in time for the London Perl Workshop).
            The second was
            <a href="/books/selenium-perl/"><i>Selenium and Perl</i></a> and
            <a href="/books/">several more</a> have followed since then.</p>

          <p>If you are interested in writing a book for the Perl School
            range, then please get in touch. We are
            <a href="https://twitter.com/perl_school">@perl_school</a> on

          <h2>About Dave Cross</h2>

          <p>[% an_image('dave', 'Dave Cross', 'float', 'jpg') -%]
            Dave Cross has been programming professionally since 1988 and
            using Perl since 1996. In that time he has used Perl as a glue
            language, for web development and as a general purpose
            programming language. He is the author of <i>Data Munging with
            Perl</i> (Manning, 2001) and a co-author of <i>Perl Template
            Toolkit</i> (O’Reilly, 2003). He has also written articles about
            Perl for <i>The Perl Journal</i> and <i>Linux Format</i>.</p>

          <p>Dave has run training courses on Perl since 2001. He has run
            in-house courses for companies ranging from investment banks to
            dotcoms and he regularly runs public courses in London. He is
            often invited to give training courses alongside open source
            conferences like the UKUUG Spring Conference and the London Perl
            Workshop. He is a regular speaker at both Perl and open source
            conferences.</p>

          <p>Dave has been heavily involved in the Perl community for many
            years. In 1998, he founded the London Perl Mongers, the first
            Perl Users’ Group in Europe and he lead the group for its first
            four years. He then became the International User Groups
            Co-ordinator for the Perl Foundation. In 2004 he was awarded a
            White Camel award for his services to the Perl community.</p>

          <p>Dave owns and runs
            <a href="https://mag-sol.com/">Magnum Solutions</a>, an open
            source development consultancy based in London. The rumours
            about the gold-plated cats were never true.</p>
